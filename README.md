This mono-repo contains the python related areas of `fanequi単a`, that is an [A Industriosa](https://intranet.aindustriosa.org/) project about creating an autonomous boat.

Each folder in this mono-repo is a development area for `fanequi単a`, currently we are working on the following areas:

## Mastermind 
A Machine Learning model & engine created to make `fanequi単a` aware of it's surroundings while navigating.

## Commander
[dronekit](http://python.dronekit.io/)'s project created to work together with `Mastermaind` to command `fanequi単a` using [pixhawk](https://pixhawk.org/).

* Requirements

    - Python 2.7
    - Pipenv (https://docs.pipenv.org/)


* Installation and environment activation

    ```
        >cd commander/
        >pipenv install
        >pipenv shell
    ```

* Configure connection environment

    You must check what port you have to connect depending your OS ((http://python.dronekit.io/guide/connecting_vehicle.html#get-started-connecting))

    You can configure your own environment with your custom file `.env`:

    ```
        >copy env.sample .env
        >vim .env
    ```

    Activate the environment:

    ```
        >export `cat .env`
    ```


* First connection

    ```
        >cd commander/
        >./main.py
    ```

* Listen location, attitude, velocity and gps

    ```
        >cd commander/
        >./main.py -l
    ```
